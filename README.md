## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Angelina Lapin, a student at Noroff in Norway and a passionate web developer with a knack for creating engaging and user-friendly web applications. I love bringing ideas to life with clean and efficient code, and Iâ€™m always excited to learn new technologies and improve my skills. My projects often involve HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I enjoy working on the front-end of web development.

Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out if youâ€™d like to collaborate or chat about all things tech!
